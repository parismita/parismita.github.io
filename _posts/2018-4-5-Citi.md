## Summer Internship as Software Developer

I did my 3rd year summer internship as a software developer at CitiCorp. My work basically contained modernizing the existing trading web application to a dashboard based application. I was a great learning experience for me, as I started with zero knowledge in areas of webapps such as Angular and Rest-api. Also, I got to leard a lot about maker-checker processes and how the trading actually works and what is the role of banks in it.
