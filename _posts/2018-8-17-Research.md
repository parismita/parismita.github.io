# Pion Mass Reconstruction

Neutrinos are omnipresent in nature, but it is very difficult to detect due to its low mass, lack of electric charge and rare interaction with matter. They interact only via gravity and the neutral current or charged current weak interactions.

The detector 


One of the challenges faced in Particle Physics Experiment after the collision of particles in LHC is the reconstruction of the events.This includes finding the type of daughter particles created and other important characteristics associated with particles like energy, from the data recorded by Detectors.

The aim of this project is to investigate new methods based on statistics, Machine Learning, and/or image processing for high resolution detectors or sub-detectors in HEP. In addition, the studied algorithms must have all the good properties (parallel and vectorized) to run efficiently on extensible processor and GPU platforms (High Performance Computing). This project will be achieved with a strong collaboration with physicists.
