# Pion Mass Reconstruction

Neutrinos are omnipresent in nature, but it is very difficult to detect due to its lack of electric charge and rare interaction with matter. They interact only via neutral current or charged current weak interactions.As the part of the  detector we are using an electromagnetic calorimeter made of plastic scintillator,  


The aim of this project is to investigate new methods based on statistics, Machine Learning, and/or image processing for high resolution detectors or sub-detectors in HEP.
