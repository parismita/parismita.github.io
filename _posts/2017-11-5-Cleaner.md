# Automated Toilet Cleaner

This is a very basic automated toilet cleaner made out of household products such as used loofah and wooden rods.

The motivation behind making this is to use waste household products and make something useful out of it and automate 
cleaning work to make our daily life more easy. 

This project consist of 2 joints, each containing 1 servo motor which is controlled by arduino. 
This is a process running on arduino which states on what angle the servo should move at what time.
Hence repeating the process after every 5 minutes.
