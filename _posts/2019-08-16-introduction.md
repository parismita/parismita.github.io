Hello, I am Parismita Das. I am currently doing my Masters at IIT Bombay, in Computer Science and Engineering. I have done my BTech at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati in Engineering Phycis .

My interests lie in the area of Database Architectures and Largescale System design and I look forward to working further on this field and widen my knowledge in this area.

Before doing my masters, I have been working with ES Magico Experiences in building products for startups such as Vidyakul, Qriteek, UStart. I have worked as a Full Stack Developer to develop end to end product for these startups, mostly using MERN stack.

Previously, I've worked on building R package for Maximum Margin Interval Trees with Prof. Torsten Horthon, Dr Alexendra Droulin and Prof. Toby Hocking. It is a package for interval regression which is highly useful in the field of genomics and medicine. As my research during Btech, I've worked on Pion detection using pattern recognition and machine learning, with Prof. Bipul Bhuyan and my fellow colleagues Maharnab Bhattacharjee and Hussain Rasiwala.

I also have a keen interest in building intelligent robots, and integrating the fields of machine learning and robotics to build useful products and have done several small projects related to it as a side hobby.
