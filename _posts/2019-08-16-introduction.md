Hello, I am Parismita Das. I am currently doing Masters (MTech) at IIT Bombay, in Computer Science and Engineering. I have done my BTech at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati in Engineering Phycis .

My interests lie in the area of database systems and largescale system design. I look forward to working further on these fields and widen my knowledge in this area.

I have been working with ES Magico Experiences in building products for startups such as Vidyakul, Qriteek, UStart. I have worked as a Full Stack Developer to develop end to end product for these startups, mostly using MERN stack.

Previously, I've worked on building R package for Maximum Margin Interval Trees with Prof. Torsten Horthon, Dr Alexendra Droulin and Prof. Toby Hocking. It is a package for interval regression which is highly useful in the field of genomics and medicine. As my research during Btech, I've worked on Pion detection using pattern recognition and machine learning, with Prof. Bipul Bhuyan and my fellow colleagues Maharnab Bhattacharjee and Hussain Rasiwala.

Please checkout the projects and experience section for more details. Thank You,
