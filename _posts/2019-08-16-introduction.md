Hello, I am Parismita Das. I recently graduated as Bachelor of Technology in Engineering Phycis at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati.

My research interests lie in application of machine learning in the field of Computer Vision.

As research and development work, I've worked on building R package for Maximum Margin Interval Trees with Prof. Torsten Horthon, Dr Alexendra Droulin and Prof. Toby Hocking. It is a package for interval regression which is highly useful in the field of genomics and medicine.

As my research during Btech, I've worked on Pion detection using pattern recognition and machine learning, with Prof. Bipul Bhuyan and my fellow colleagues Maharnab Bhattacharjee and Hussain Rasiwala.

I have a keen interest in building intelligent robots, and integrating the fields of machine learning and robotics to build useful products and have done several small projects related to it. I look forward to working further on this field and widen my knowledge in this area.
