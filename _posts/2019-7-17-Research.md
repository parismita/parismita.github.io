# Simulation and Reconstruction of EM shower and neutral pion in a Plastic Scintillator Detector

Neutrinos are abundant in nature, but it is very difficult to detect the neutrinos as
they are electrically neutral and they interact only via weak interactions. We aim
to observe the electron produced due to neutrino interaction with the nucleus of
detector material.

But there can be neutral pion production due to neutrino-nucleus interaction
in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The gamma showers obtained from neutral pion decay
acts as background as it can be easily mistaken to be an electron shower. Hence
removal of neutral pion is very important for differentiating an electron shower from gamma shower.

The aim of this project is to investigate new methods based on statistics and machine
learning to determine the basic characteristics of π 0 like its mass, position, separation
angle between both gamma particles, momentum, kinetic energy etc.

## The Detector 
To study the characteristics of the particles, the simulation of the real detector is
done using Geant4 software. The detector that we are using to study neutral pion
decay is an electromagnetic calorimeter made of consecutive alternating horizontal
and vertical bars of plastic scintillator with lead plates in between them.

The simulated detector is made according to the known standard Electromagnetic
calorimeter which shows maximum efficiency in detection of particle’s hits data
(hits data is the data containing information about position, momentum, kinetic
energy etc of the particle). Each plate consists of 160 bars aligned in a particular 
direction with dimensions as 4m × 2.5cm × 1cm. Each lead plate is of dimension
4m × 4m × 1.75mm. Hence the overall dimension of Detector is 4m × 4m × 0.7m
The Scintillator material is used for detection of the pion as it absorbs the incoming
particles energy and re-emits as light which we measure and use for further analysis.
Lead Sheet is used for slowing down the particles so that it doesn’t escape the
detector.
