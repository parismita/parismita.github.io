# Pion Mass Reconstruction

Neutrinos are omnipresent in nature, but it is very difficult to detect due to its lack of electric charge and rare interaction with matter. They interact only via neutral current or charged current weak interactions.

The part of the  detector we are using is an electromagnetic calorimeter made of plastic scintillator. As we want to detect the electron scattering from the neutrino because electrons have characteristic signatures in particle detectors and are thus fairly easy to identify. They also have the advantage that they “flavour-tag” the neutrino: if an electron is produced, it came from an electron-neutrino. 

Hence we want to detect the neutral pion decay background and remove them. So that it do not interfare with the electron showers. The method of mass peak is used for the detection of the pion showers.

The aim of this project is to investigate new methods based on statistics, Machine Learning, and/or image processing for detection of the two gamma showers originatying from the pion.
